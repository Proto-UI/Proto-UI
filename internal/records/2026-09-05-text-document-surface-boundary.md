# Text Document / Editor Surface boundary for later Agent Harness work

Date: 2026-09-05

Status: non-normative research recommendation for #531. This record does not admit a Contract, Module, Host Capability, Prototype, Adapter relation, editor engine, document model, language service, persistence path, or implementation.

Refs: #389 (Text Control/Input), #513 (Agent Harness tracker), #514 (coverage matrix), #517 (Code Block), #521 (windowing), #529 (Artifact Workspace/static Diff Review), #531 (this research).

## Recommendation

Advance **option C: a narrow single-document plain-text Editor Surface proposal checkpoint**. Keep the document model, text storage, edit application, undo/redo stack, selection objects, tokenization, viewport rendering, decorations, language services, workers, and host accessibility implementation inside an infrastructure-exempt editor engine. Keep file identity, source revision, persistence, permissions, save/revert, conflicts, audit, and diagnostics truth App-owned.

The next checkpoint should consider one semantic Module plus one lease-shaped Host Capability for an opaque document/revision reference, attachment/read-only/status facts, revision-bound transaction summaries, bounded selection summaries, engine-command requests, Focus-domain integration, Module-owned connection identities, and stale-result suppression. It should not admit an editor engine, public Prototype, syntax/diagnostic semantics, multi-document workbench, or Adapter support claim.

Classification: **next proposal checkpoint**. The editor/document engine remains **infrastructure-exempt behind a narrow host surface**.

Option A remains the honest fallback for small unrevisioned plain text (`P-BASE-TEXTAREA`), structural code/log presentation (#517), and immutable diff review (#529). Option B pays editor/model/accessibility cost but adds little beyond those fallbacks. Option C is the first slice with an editor-specific user job: maintain one revisioned editing session with engine-owned selection and undo while the App remains persistence authority.

## Evidence and authority

### Repository authority

The following catalog entities are draft unless stated otherwise:

- `C-TEXT-CONTROL-0001-A/C/F/G/I`, `M-TEXT-CONTROL-0001`, and `HC-TEXT-CONTROL-0001` govern one host-selected single- or multiline plain-text control, normalized value/input/composition behavior, and a bounded host lease. They do not govern a revisioned document, editor transactions, model lifetime, undo, decorations, or language services.
- `D-TEXT-CONTROL-PROJECTION-0001-A/C/D/E` keeps selection, cursor, IME, software keyboard, edit menus, and system editing chrome host-owned and limits current conformance to Web hosts. `D-TEXT-CONTROL-PROJECTION-0001-Q-SELECTION` already owns the open question of when selection facts/requests enter the plain Text Control contract.
- `P-BASE-TEXTAREA-PHYSICAL-TARGET`, `P-BASE-TEXTAREA-EVENTS-AND-IME`, and `P-BASE-TEXTAREA-BOUNDARY` define a contentless multiline leaf and explicitly exclude rich text, system selection/edit-menu ownership, auto-resize, and a second editor.
- `P-BASE-INPUT-PHYSICAL-TARGET` and `P-BASE-INPUT-BOUNDARY` make the same negative boundary for single-line text entry. Merged PR #547 generalized the shared Text Control line-mode implementation without adding document semantics.
- `K-HOST-SURFACE-ROLES-0001-D` and `C-HOST-SURFACE-PROJECTION-0001-B/D/E` keep raw targets/controllers in translation and require logical-boundary stability plus replacement cleanup.
- `C-FOCUS-0001`, `C-A11Y-0001`, and `C-SCROLL-0001` retain focus, accessibility semantic projection, and logical scrolling ownership. An Editor Surface may consume these domains but may not copy their state machines.
- Active `D-ADAPTER-PROFILE-0001-B/C/D/E` prohibits inferring reviewed Module support or Host Capability provision from a package or same-Web evidence.

Current source and tests confirm the adjacent boundary:

- `packages/core/src/text-control.ts` exposes line-mode patches, normalized editing/composition events, and only value/composition snapshots.
- `packages/modules/text-control/src/caps.ts` uses a data-only `attach`/`update`/`snapshot`/`dispose` lease.
- `packages/modules/text-control/src/web.ts` keeps concrete Web targets, listeners, selection preservation, scroll offsets, and IME mechanics in the host bridge.
- `packages/modules/text-control/test/impl-spec.test.ts` proves value, IME, and lease behavior through a fake host.
- `T-TEXT-CONTROL-0001`, `T-BASE-TEXTAREA-0001`, and `T-BASE-INPUT-0001` bind the current leaf-control evidence. No `T-TEXT-DOCUMENT-*` or `T-EDITOR-SURFACE-*` evidence exists.
- Targeted searches found no Text Document/Editor Surface, CodeMirror, Monaco `ITextModel`, or comparable editor implementation in `packages/**` or `apps/www/src/**`.

`internal/records/2026-08-02-text-control-host-boundary.zh-CN.md` explains the host-owned plain-text boundary. `internal/records/2026-08-29-code-block-composition-first-slice-design.md` keeps code, highlighting, selection, and Clipboard outside Code Block. Issue #529 keeps immutable diff computation, revisions, patch semantics, and side effects App-owned. These are context or scoped work, not authority to admit an editor.

### External primary sources

Web evidence was inspected from Monaco Editor:

- [README at `d620ca0c03d24a51c05ae4dca8a9d5923a4aeb9c`](https://github.com/microsoft/monaco-editor/blob/d620ca0c03d24a51c05ae4dca8a9d5923a4aeb9c/README.md) separates file-like models, URI identity, text content/edit history, DOM editor views, language-feature providers, workers, and disposal.
- [public `monaco.d.ts` at gh-pages `b86a4f9e56a3228b067578205655e2307ae89d44`](https://github.com/microsoft/monaco-editor/blob/b86a4f9e56a3228b067578205655e2307ae89d44/node_modules/monaco-editor/monaco.d.ts) gives models distinct IDs/URIs and version IDs; exposes range-based change events, selections, composition, paste, focus, layout, scroll, hidden areas, serializable view state, multi-cursor behavior, decorations, accessibility page size, and `tabFocusMode`; and represents listeners as disposables.
- [Accessibility Guide for Integrators](https://github.com/microsoft/monaco-editor/wiki/Accessibility-Guide-for-Integrators) requires host-provided action keybindings, an accessible label, high-contrast decisions, screen-reader support configuration, and accessibility help. It records that wrapping may need host/engine adaptation for screen readers.

Non-Web evidence was inspected from current Microsoft native-editor documentation:

- [WinUI RichEditBox guidance](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/apps/develop/ui/controls/rich-edit-box), source revision `fd2cde64baabeded5e3cf17f33b8787c9e468691`, separates the editor control from surrounding toolbar/file controls and exposes an `ITextDocument` for content, ranges, selection, undo/redo, loading, and saving.
- [RichEditTextDocument](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/windows-app-sdk/api/winrt/microsoft.ui.text.richedittextdocument), source revision `70ebf766b73dd46f874ded9cfcf5b01d4476048d`, owns selection, undo grouping/history, ranges, streams, text, formatting, and display-update batching.
- [UI Automation TextPattern](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/framework/ui-automation/ui-automation-textpattern-overview), source revision `156931bb4ec1e81b028c76ea983553f2e9778bdd`, exposes document text as ranges with selection/change events and platform navigation. It warns that ranges may become invalid after replacement, accessibility text is broadly readable by clients, and range access has cross-process performance costs.

The Web and native engines differ, but both keep models, selections, rendering, input services, accessibility ranges, and resource lifetime behind engine/platform APIs. That supports a data-only host surface, not a generic portable document model or a multi-host conformance claim.

## User-job and slice comparison

| Option | User job | Benefit | Cost or failure | Disposition |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| A. No editor domain | Edit a small plain-text value or read code/log/diff output. | Existing Textarea, Code Block, and static Diff boundaries remain honest and cheap. | No document revision, engine undo, durable selection, viewport restoration, or large-document session. | Keep as fallback. |
| B. Read-only document viewport with selection/copy | Navigate a document through an editor engine without editing. | Can preserve engine-native selection and accessibility ranges. | Pays model/view/a11y/lifecycle cost while overlapping Code Block/static document/diff paths; no first editor-specific editing job. | Do not make the first Proto UI slice. Private infrastructure may provide it. |
| C. Single-document plain-text Editor Surface | Maintain one revisioned editor session, apply engine-local edits/undo, and route explicit App actions. | Smallest end-to-end editor-specific job; fakeable through references and transaction summaries. | Requires revision, shortcut/IME, permission, selection-summary, view-state, and stale-callback rules. | **Recommended proposal checkpoint.** |
| D. Syntax/decorations/diagnostics | Inspect tokens, decorations, diagnostics, quick fixes, and navigation. | Useful developer experience. | Adds language-service truth, decoration identity, issue navigation, and accessibility policy. | Defer. |
| E. Multi-document/large-document workbench | Manage tabs, models, huge files, paging, branches, conflicts, and workspace commands. | Full workbench. | Conflates App workspace, persistence, windowing, editor, language, and conflict owners. | Defer. |

## Responsibility and trust table

| Layer or existing surface | Owns | Receives across the boundary | Must never expose or claim |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| App/backend | Opaque document/file identity; authoritative source revision; permissions; loading; persistence; save/revert; conflict and idempotency; language-service and diagnostics truth; audit. | Document/transaction references and explicit data-only action requests. | File handles, storage streams, credentials, VCS objects, language-server handles, authority inferred from rendered text. |
| Editor-engine infrastructure | Mutable text model; edit application; composition; selection/cursors; undo/redo; tokenization; decorations; folding; find; viewport rendering/physics/internal line windowing; view state; native text ranges/caret implementation. | Host-local target plus model/backend services injected outside portable authoring. | Engine/model/view/controller/worker, mutable ranges, DOM/native target, semantic role, logical Focus/Scroll ownership, framework component, host view-state object. |
| Proto UI Text Document semantic owner | One logical surface identity; composite document/model-session/source/content/mutation identity; lease epoch; attachment/read-only/input-enabled facts; commit-stamped transaction authorization context; revision-bound transaction observations; bounded composition/selection availability; engine-command correlation; stale UI rejection. It consumes Focus identity/view epoch and resolved Scroll facts/requests rather than owning them. | Immutable references, status facts, summaries, and requests. | Full document, raw changes/models, focus facts, Scroll support/geometry/physics, tokenizer/diagnostic objects, raw events, persistence authority, engine undo data. |
| Text Document Host Capability | Resolve model by composite `{ documentId, modelSessionId }`, underlying App document service by `documentId`, and current target/view from host configuration; attach engine; bridge IME/keyboard; stamp initiating view/policy context at commit; expose targets/controllers to Focus/Scroll/A11y integration; apply read-only policy; emit bounded view facts; preserve view state; clean up. | Static requirement and mutable patch plus adapter-injected resolvers keyed by opaque IDs. | No target/model/editor/range/selection/file/stream/worker/callback source returned to portable authoring; no semantic focus, role, or logical Scroll support ownership. |
| Adapter profile | Materialize boundary/surface/input/a11y targets; wire capability; translate lifecycle and Focus participation. | Governed Module requirement only after admission. | No semantic reinterpretation and no support/provision relation before profile evidence. |
| Composition/design language | Tabs/breadcrumbs, toolbar, filename/revision/status, dirty/conflict badge, explicit Save/Revert, find controls if later admitted, diagnostics list if later admitted. | App facts and ordinary Proto UI control events. | Document storage/model, edit transactions, undo stack, language/diagnostic truth, direct engine action during render. |
| Base Textarea | Small unrevisioned multiline plain-text value protocol. | Value/property facts and normalized input/IME. | Document identity/revision, transactions, engine model, multi-cursor, workbench. |
| Code Block | Structural presentation of App-authored code/log content. | Authored text/tokens and ordinary child controls. | Editing, selection, Clipboard, document history, language services. |
| Static Diff Review | App-local immutable change presentation and explicit review actions. | App-computed diff/revision labels. | Edit model, patch application, persistence, conflict resolution. |

The engine can remain completely outside Proto UI. Host configuration resolves the model by the composite opaque key `{ documentId, modelSessionId }` and the underlying App document service by `documentId`; neither member is assumed globally unique by itself, and no engine or document object crosses portable authoring.

## Portable facts, requests, and information paths

### Candidate first-slice values

Names below illustrate a proposal; they are not an admitted API:

- App input: immutable stable `surfaceId` plus `document: { documentId, modelSessionId }`; the composite pair is the model key, and the model-session service owns source/saved content. Mutable resolved `editingMode: interactive | read-only | disabled` and status policy crosses per view. Role/name/description remain A11y; help is composition/relation.
- Host facts: discriminated attachment; post-attachment facts/policy revisions; ready model/source/mutation/content; independent composition and bounded-selection availability/facts; input/keyboard-route/A11y/view-state support. Module derives dirty. Focus and resolved Scroll facts remain in their domains.
- Model transaction summary: `{ documentId, modelSessionId, transactionId }`, document/source/mutation/content identity, immutable commit-time origin authorization context, disposition/count, and no observer freshness. The durable dispatcher reaches App once; a per-connection observation envelope adds the observing view's applied policy/facts revision for optional UI delivery.
- Engine requests/results: mutation/policy-bound undo/redo and explicit snapshot/export by the App-owned service. Line navigation remains deferred. Focus/blur remain in Focus. Save/revert remain App actions.

The first slice's selection summary is intentionally bounded to `{ count, primaryCollapsed }` plus the current monotonic mutation revision. No raw range, selected text, mutable selection, pixel rectangle, or ungoverned line/column encoding crosses. A later line/column or range API needs an explicit Unicode position encoding and revision semantics.

This resolves the seam with `D-TEXT-CONTROL-PROJECTION-0001-Q-SELECTION` without closing it: plain Text Control selection remains that decision's open question. Revision-bound document selection is a different future contract and must not be retrofitted into `TextControlHandle`. Neither surface gains `selectAll`, `setSelection`, or `replaceSelection` in this first slice.

### Information paths

| Input | Owner path | Observable output | Synchronization boundary |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Document/model identity | App -> immutable Text Document requirement -> Host Capability resolver | Correct shared/private model and view appear even when different documents reuse a locally scoped session ID. | Resolve model by composite `{ documentId, modelSessionId }`; use `documentId` alone only for the underlying App document service. |
| Source content/revision | App model-session service -> engine/model dispatcher | Engine renders text and all attached views observe one current persisted base. | Composite document/model session owns source revision and changes once for all its views. |
| IME/text/key input | Physical editor -> initiating view bridge -> engine/model dispatcher | Engine applies one transaction; the Module stamps immutable initiating surface/connection/applied-policy context at commit; durable model delivery reaches App exactly once even if views detach. | Composition support, composite model key, mutation revision, and commit-time interactive authorization; observer freshness does not govern durability. |
| Edit details | Model dispatcher -> App service; views receive optional observation envelopes | App validates origin context and persists `persist` by `{ documentId, modelSessionId, transactionId }`; stale view observation may drop without data loss. | Shared summary retains immutable origin authorization but no observing-view revision; each envelope binds only its current recipient connection/policy/facts revision. |
| Save/Revert | Button -> App/model-session service | Save atomically advances model-session source revision and saved content version for all views sharing the composite model key; Module derives dirty. | App idempotency plus composite model/source/content identity; no per-view stale base. |
| Undo/Redo | App/semantic command -> Module -> Host Capability -> engine | Engine transaction and availability facts. | Expected mutation/policy revision validated before mutation; committed result is stamped with initiating authorization context. |
| Selection/caret | Engine | Native accessibility exposes ranges; when supported, Proto receives only count/collapsed summary; unsupported summary is explicit and carries no selection fact. | Monotonic facts and selection revisions within connection/policy; engine selection remains usable independently. |
| Focus/Tab escape | Focus domain / host keyboard arbiter -> editor or Harness | Exactly one focus destination; facts return only through Focus. | Focus identity/view epoch and shortcut policy. |
| Accessible role/naming | A11y semantic object -> HC-A11Y/Adapter -> editor target | One role/name/description projection; App help control uses existing relations. | A11y identity and target replacement; engine supplies native implementation, not role truth. |
| Viewport/scroll | Text Document registers one logical Scroll surface; M-SCROLL/HC-SCROLL-SURFACE map requests/facts to editor controller | Portable logical scroll facts/requests; engine retains physics/rendering/internal line windowing. | Scroll view epoch plus host-local geometry/controller; no raw view state. |
| Diagnostics/decorations | App language service -> later engine/composition slice | Deferred. | No first-slice channel. |

```

1. attach two surfaces to `{ documentId: doc-7, modelSessionId: default }`; resolve the same model, while `{ doc-8, default }` and `{ doc-7, model-4 }` resolve independent models and view-state keys;
2. receive attaching/null policy, then ready with facts revision 1 plus input/transaction-origin/keyboard/A11y/view support; resolve Scroll support separately through `M-SCROLL-0001`;
3. commit `tx-1` from the interactive surface; durable `{ doc-7, default, tx-1 }` summary carries its immutable initiating surface/connection/policy context; App validates that context and persists once, while each observation envelope has only its recipient policy/facts revision;
4. deliver the same model transaction to a read-only sibling view; its observation cannot replace the interactive origin context or authorize a second persistence;
5. detach one view before observation; stale UI drops but durable delivery remains once;
6. recover unavailable -> ready; older failure loses by facts revision;
7. make composition unavailable while input/selection remain available, then selection summary unavailable while input/composition remain available; each branch has an exact reason and null unavailable fact without disabling engine-local selection;
8. move supported selection twice without edit; facts/selection revisions order callbacks;
9. exercise interactive/read-only/disabled: only interactive edits; undo/redo under non-interactive mode returns `policy-denied` before engine mutation; unavailable origin stamping resolves read-only/unavailable rather than emitting a persistable edit;
10. during available active composition, IME-consumed Enter/Tab/Escape reaches engine before Harness shortcuts; after composition, registered shortcut precedence resumes;
11. make Tab/F6 exit route unavailable; Host reports `keyboard-route-unavailable` and composition acceptance rejects independently of Button;
12. save model content/source centrally for all views sharing the composite model key; dirty/source remain coherent;
13. enforce strict policy updates and per-view observation envelopes; durable summary retains commit-time origin authorization but no observer freshness;
14. App-origin transaction is observe-only; no persistence echo;
15. unavailable/error carries facts/policy revision but no engine fields; unavailable command omits mutation/content;
16. switch `surface-2` between composite model keys; view-state keys `{ surfaceId, documentId, modelSessionId }` never collide;
17. map role/name only A11y and focus only Focus; consume logical viewport/support only from Scroll and prove Text Document reports no second Scroll truth;
18. complete stale UI callbacks without suppressing durable transactions;
19. prove no raw engine/model/range/target/scroll controller/file/document/system-duplicate/view-state value crosses.

This proves composite model-session identity, commit-time authorization provenance, resolved editing mode, independently degraded composition/selection, composition-aware arbitration, keyboard-route support, model-scoped view state, monotonic UI revisions, recipient-only observation envelopes, durable delivery, and system-domain ownership. It does not prove real host behavior.

## Revision, input, shortcut, and permission policy

- **Revision, transaction, and authorization ownership:** the composite `{ documentId, modelSessionId }` service owns current `sourceRevision`; monotonic mutation prevents ABA; content version identifies equality. Durable `{ documentId, modelSessionId, transactionId }` summaries emit once and retain immutable initiating `surfaceId`, `connectionId`, applied policy revision, and `editingMode: interactive` captured at commit. The App/backend validates that context against its permission decision before persistence. Recipient observation envelopes carry separate current policy/facts revisions and may stale-drop; they never rewrite origin authorization. User/undo/redo persist; App origin observes only. If the host cannot correlate and stamp the initiating view at commit, `transaction-origin-unavailable` prevents interactive persistable delivery.
- **Save/conflict/dirty:** Save/Revert invokes the App's composite model-session service. Success atomically advances source revision and saved content version for every attached view sharing that key; the next facts publication carries both, with no per-view patch or stale base. Dirty compares content versions. Lifecycle never saves.
- **IME and shortcut precedence:** candidate/composition UI stays engine-owned. When composition support is available and composition is active, keys consumed by IME (including Enter/Tab/Escape) reach engine first and cannot dispatch Harness commands. After composition ends, explicitly registered Harness commands precede ordinary editor key processing. Unavailable composition is reported independently from committed input and never fabricates `composing`.
- **Text versus command keys:** engine owns editing/cursor/undo/indent. App commands use host arbiter; no native key object crosses.
- **Tab and escape:** Web host reports Tab/F6 route in `keyboardRoute`; composition owns leave Button/Focus topology. Either unavailable route or absent control fails acceptance.
- **Clipboard/paste:** system/editor owns; only a resulting persistable transaction with commit-stamped authorization enters the durable model dispatcher.
- **Editing mode and policy:** one resolved mode replaces conflicting booleans. Only `interactive` with `transactionOrigin: commit-stamped` may emit persistable edits or execute undo/redo. `read-only` preserves focus/engine-local selection; `disabled` blocks entry. Commands in non-interactive modes return `policy-denied` before engine mutation. Every update is strictly newer; committed transactions remain durable.
- **Mobile:** host IME/touch chrome; input, composition, selection-summary, and exit support report independently. Unavailable composition/selection may select a documented degraded or read-only path without claiming their facts; unavailable exit blocks composed acceptance.

## Accessibility boundary

- App supplies editor role/name/description through A11y semantic-object facts. Help is App composition through existing relations; no help fact. Adapter projects A11y IR; engine/Host Capability supplies native editable control, text ranges, caret behavior, wrapping, and screen-reader editing mechanics without second role ownership.
- `DocumentSelectionSummary` supports low-cost status only; native accessibility exposes ranges. Later line/column API needs encoding/replacement rules.
- Streaming edit/caret does not feed live region. Announcements are bounded to read-only/save/conflict/rejection. Diagnostics is option D.
- Web evidence covers A11y role/name/description/help relation, screen-reader mode, Tab-focus, composition, selection, read-only, Scroll integration, zoom/wrap/high contrast, focus entry/exit, and no duplicates.
- Native evidence may use UIA TextPattern or equivalent; sensitive content projection is App/Host privacy. Degradation explicit.
- Large-document accessibility and range-query performance are option E. Same-Web WC/React/Vue results cannot establish native-host conformance.

## Performance, viewport, windowing, and lifecycle

- Full document/model/token/decorations/internal viewport lines do not enter generic Proto State.
- Durable model transactions are view-independent but retain immutable commit-time origin authorization; App validates and dedupes `{ documentId, modelSessionId, transactionId }` and ignores observe-only. Recipient view envelopes may stale-drop and cannot change origin.
- Text Document registers a logical Scroll surface. `M-SCROLL-0001` exclusively owns portable Scroll identity/facts/requests/support and view epoch; `HC-SCROLL-SURFACE-0001` maps the engine controller behind a lease. Text Document consumes that resolved state and never republishes a Scroll support field. Engine owns physics/rendering/internal line windowing; #521 applies to external authored Collections, not engine lines.
- Raw geometry/view state remains host-private; restoration keys `{ surfaceId, documentId, modelSessionId }` so independent sessions never share cursor/selection/folding/scroll state.
- One surface holds immutable surface plus composite document/model requirement and view connection. Identity replacement reattaches; model source updates centrally; mutable update is strictly increasing policy only. Loading is represented only by the `status` discriminant; no duplicate boolean exists.
- Every post-attachment facts branch has facts revision; available selection adds selection revision. Composition/selection unavailable branches contain null facts and exact reasons. UI callbacks stale-suppress; durable transactions never use observer freshness.
- Disposal removes input, Focus bridge, separately owned Scroll lease/controller, view observations, A11y projection, and target refs. Shared model/dispatcher/App sink stay App-owned.
- View lease does not dispose App-owned model/file/language/storage sessions.
- Unsupported model/target/input/transaction-origin/composition/selection/keyboard-route/A11y/view-state/read-only fails closed or degrades only through its explicit bounded branch; Scroll availability remains solely in the Scroll domain.

## Proposed entity and evidence graph

If a maintainer later accepts semantic admission, the smallest coherent graph is:

```text
C-TEXT-DOCUMENT-SURFACE-0001 (draft contract)
  <- satisfied by M-TEXT-DOCUMENT-SURFACE-0001
       -> requires HC-TEXT-DOCUMENT-SURFACE-0001
  <- verified by T-TEXT-DOCUMENT-SURFACE-0001

K-HOST-SURFACE-ROLES-0001
C-HOST-SURFACE-PROJECTION-0001
C-FOCUS-0001 / C-A11Y-0001
C-SCROLL-0001 / M-SCROLL-0001 / HC-SCROLL-SURFACE-0001
D-TEXT-CONTROL-PROJECTION-0001-Q-SELECTION (related seam, not replaced)

A-REACT-18-19-0001
  -> may later support/provide the new Module/Host Capability only after
     reviewed Web evidence
```

No new Adapter identity is justified: existing profiles receive reviewed relations only after evidence. No public Prototype is justified by this research alone. Prototype identity/anatomy and editor chrome require a later admitted authoring slice. Text Control remains unchanged; the document selection contract is related but separate.

### Bounded red-first plan

1. **Portable negatives:** reject raw engine/model/target/range/worker/stream/file/framework/native event/geometry/document/token/view-state/scroll-controller/service values; reject identity in mutable updates.
2. **Fake lease:** composite document/model-session resolution, immutable attach, strict policy, editing modes, keyboard-route support, source update across views, model-scoped view state, replacement, cleanup, stale UI suppression without edit loss.
3. **Revisions/transactions:** composite model key and triple idempotency key; UI revisions/content equality; immutable commit-time origin authorization; recipient-only observation freshness; exactly-once persistence; App observe-only; shared save; undo dirty/conflict.
4. **Input/permissions/commands:** independent input/composition/selection support and exact unavailable facts; IME-first only while supported composition is active, then Harness shortcut precedence; editing-mode and transaction-origin gates; policy-denied/stale/unavailable result branches; composition Button/Focus; regressing policy rejection.
5. **Selection/availability/view identity:** facts revision on post-attachment/ready branches; ready-only engine fields; null policy only attaching; `{surface,document,model}` view key; loading status single-valued; line navigation deferred.
6. **A11y/Focus/Scroll fakes:** role/name only A11y; help composition; focus only Focus; logical viewport/support consumed exclusively through Scroll; keyboard-route support explicit; no duplicate Scroll fact.
7. **Real Web:** editing modes, commit-time authorization stamping, composition arbitration/degradation, Tab/F6 support, bounded selection availability/undo, shared composite-key model save, model-scoped view restore, replacement, A11y, Scroll, cleanup.
8. **Performance:** rapid edits/caret movement and a bounded first-slice document prove no full-content/token/viewport copies through Proto UI and no retained listeners/models.
9. **Cross-adapter Web only if claimed:** WC/React/Vue from one authoring source remains Web evidence.
10. **Non-Web:** independent native profile with native input, selection, revision, accessibility, view replacement, and cleanup evidence before multi-host language.

## #513/#514 matrix consumption

PR #563 carries `internal/agent-harness/dogfood-coverage-matrix.md`, but it is not on `main`, is conflicting, and has an active `CHANGES_REQUESTED` review. This record must not copy that matrix or create a second source of truth.

After the matrix carrier lands, a follow-up #531 carrier must update exactly:

- `harness.future.editor-chrome`: replace pending ownership with the option-C recommendation; keep `research` until semantic admission, link this record, name the proposed `C-*` / `M-*` / `HC-*` / `T-*` checkpoint, distinguish Textarea/Code Block/static Diff fallbacks, and trigger re-review on admission outcome, selection position encoding, syntax/diagnostics, multi-document/large-document scope, or non-Web claims.
- `harness.future.editor-engine`: retain `infrastructure-exempt`; settle the exemption for model/content/edit/undo/selection/rendering/tokenization/view-state internals; state that engine selection, persistence/service binding, raw-model leakage, or capability expansion triggers re-review.
- Recompute totals only if a state changes. This recommendation keeps both current state counts unchanged.

#513 should receive the landed record/matrix-carrier link. #514 remains owner of the single matrix. Until that projection lands, #531 is advanced rather than closed.

## Acceptance mapping

- Textarea, Code Block, static Diff, App/backend, editor engine, Proto UI semantic owner, Host Capability/Adapter, and composition responsibilities are distinct.
- Options A-E are compared; C is the smallest proposed editor-specific slice and D/E are explicit deferrals.
- Document/source/engine revisions, transactions, input/shortcuts/IME/Tab, selection, accessibility, permission change, viewport/windowing, lifecycle, and cleanup are bounded.
- No raw editor, model, document/range/selection, host target, worker, stream, language service, or file object enters portable authoring.
- No third-party editor is treated as Proto UI-owned UI; its model/view/a11y implementation remains infrastructure.
- The conclusion is one `next proposal checkpoint`; no materially different viable owner remains unresolved in this packet.
- The exact #513/#514 rows and re-review triggers are identified; their authoritative projection remains the next carrier after PR #563.

## Residual risks and smallest human decision

Residual risks: transaction IDs require a robust App-owned service contract; revision and replacement races can lose or duplicate edits; Unicode position encoding is intentionally deferred; screen-reader editor behavior varies; permission revocation during composition can discard a candidate; view-state/model ownership differs across engines; sensitive document content may be exposed through platform accessibility; selected engines may not support the required separation.

Smallest later human decision: accept or reject admission of the proposed `C-TEXT-DOCUMENT-SURFACE-0001` / `M-TEXT-DOCUMENT-SURFACE-0001` / `HC-TEXT-DOCUMENT-SURFACE-0001` / `T-TEXT-DOCUMENT-SURFACE-0001` graph for option C with the exclusions above. Acceptance authorizes a separate spec proposal, not an engine choice, Prototype, or implementation. Rejection leaves option A plus private editor infrastructure and ordinary Proto UI chrome.
